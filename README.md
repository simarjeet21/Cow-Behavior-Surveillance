# Cow Behavior Frame Extractor using YOLOv8

This project extracts frames from a video **only when cows are detected**, using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It's designed for preprocessing surveillance or farm videos to isolate relevant behavior frames for further analysis (e.g., annotation, training, monitoring).
